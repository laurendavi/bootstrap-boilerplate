# This is my README!

I'm using StackEdit to create this README file! This is making a lot more sense now that I can see what I'm writing. I think this README file is just an essay. That I can do.


# What Else?

This is a sentence so I can **bold** a word.

This is a Bootstrap 5.1 boilerplate template. It uses the 5.1 CDN and only uses 1 bootstap link in the head tag & 1 script tag at the end of the body tag.
